Linear perceptron is one of the simplest learning algorithms for a two-class classifier. Given a set of data points in d-dimensions, belonging to two classes, C1 and C2, the algorithm tries to find a linear separating hyper-plane between the samples of the two classes. If the samples are in one, two or three dimensions, the separating hyperplane would be a point, line or a plane respectively. The specific algorithm that we look into is a special case of a class of algorithms that uses gradient descent on a carefully defined objective function to arrive at a solution.
