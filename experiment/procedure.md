**Stage 1:**

  1. Create a linearly separable dataset by clicking on the plane to add points to classes 1 and 2.

  2. Click start to initialize the weight vector (you may re-initialize by clicking on it again).

  3. Click the step button to see the stepping through the algorithm.

  4. Note number of iterations for convergence.

**Stage 2:**

  1. Repeat the above procedure for the different datasets with varying amount of separation between them. Note down your observations.

**Stage 3:**

  1. Study the effect of varying the decay rate with different amounts of separability.
